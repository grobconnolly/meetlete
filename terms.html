From time to time, Fans may create a thirty (30) second introduction video about themselves, and subsequently request one or more video calls of three (3) or more minutes (each, a &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">Video Call</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;) from Talent through the Platform. &nbsp;Talent has up to seven (7) days and three (3) attempts to complete the Video Call with the Fan. If Talent does not either: (i) accept the request and complete the Video Call; or (ii) decline the request, the request will expire and can no longer be fulfilled. If Talent accepts a request, you will complete the Video Call. By participating in a Video Call, Talent can raise funds for charitable organizations that are designated by Talent, in his or her sole discretion (each, a &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">Non-Profit Partner</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;). The Non-Profit Partners designated by Talent for the Video Call then receive</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">fundraising proceeds in Meetlete&rsquo;s name proportionate to the amount Talent has designated for that particular Video Call.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">USE OF THE SERVICES</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_list_1-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c5">Services.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Services, and any parts thereof, are protected by copyright laws throughout the world.

Broad St., Suite 206, Middletown, Delaware 19709. &nbsp;The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. &nbsp;Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys&rsquo; fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS&rsquo;s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS&rsquo;s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. &nbsp;JAMS&rsquo;s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. &nbsp;If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. &nbsp;If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS&rsquo;s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Meetlete will pay them for you. &nbsp;In addition, Meetlete will reimburse all such JAMS&rsquo;s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</span></li></ol><p class="c33"><span class="c1">You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. &nbsp;Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p><ol class="c2 lst-kix_list_4-1" start="3"><li class="c3"><span class="c5">Authority of Arbitrator</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. &nbsp;The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Meetlete. &nbsp;The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c5">Waiver of Jury Trial</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;YOU AND MEETLETE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. &nbsp;You and Meetlete are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section [</span><span class="c1 c8">17.1</span><span class="c1">] above. &nbsp;An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. &nbsp;However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c5">Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection&rsquo;s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California. &nbsp;All other claims shall be arbitrated.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c5">30-Day Right to Opt Out</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: [insert email address], within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, your Meetlete username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Meetlete account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. &nbsp;Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c5">Severability</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;Except as provided in subsection [</span><span class="c1 c8">17.5</span><span class="c1">], if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c5">Survival of Agreement</span><span class="c1">.
